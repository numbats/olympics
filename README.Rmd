The `olympics` package provides an interface to scrape Olympic data from https://olympics.com/. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of olympics from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("numbats/olympics")
```

## Example

The package extracts Olympic results in a sequential order:  
  
  - a *game* slug (i.e. tokyo-2020) can be passed into `get_sports()` to find the available *sports* in the *game*, 
  - the resulting *sport* table can then be passed into `get_events()` to find the *events* under each *sport*, 
  - the *event* table can then be passed into `get_results()` to find the event results.

The tables in this pipeline can be wrangled to customise the extraction. For example, 

```{r example}
library(olympics)
get_sports(game = "tokyo-2020") %>% 
  dplyr::filter(sport == "swimming") %>% 
  get_events() %>% 
  head(1) %>% 
  get_results()
```

The full Tokyo 2020 results is available as built-in data in the package as `tokyo2020`, the same with `beijing2022`. Full results of 21st games are available at `summer_games` (Tokyo 2020, Rio 2016, London 2012, Beijing 2008, Athens 2004, and Sydney 2000) and `winter_games` (Beijing 2022, Pyeongchang 2018, Sochi 2014, Vancouver 2010, Turin 2006, and Salt Lake City 2002).
